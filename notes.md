The above section is interesting because it shows different groups of usage for the word "free":  relating to slavery, press, or passages.

I wanted to see if, when newspapers wrote about teddy bears, if they often wrote about them in terms of them being "fads." I figured if this were the case, the same newspapers with peaks in mentioning "bear" or "bears" would have similar (although smaller) peaks in words relating to "fad." This seems to be the case for the San Francisco Call, The Sun, and the Minneapolis Journal. 

# Errors
`No such file or directory. No urls found`

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1190692/error-when-using-wget-to-download-a-list-of-urls-in-a-txt-file

* Actually means file not found
  * Type name of file without extension (as appears in directory in powershell)
  * Also probably didn't need to use wget for this exercise, just needed URL list
